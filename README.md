# Colemak Club
This site is a fork of [Colemak Academy](https://colemak.academy/), a resource for learning Colemak and related keyboard layouts. The main purpose of this fork was to fix its very incorrect implementation of Colemak-DH.
It was starting to become quite a problem for the [Colemak Community](https://discordapp.com/invite/3UkgpGC), as many were investing significant time into learning the wrong layout!
However, this fork is now a platform for the community to add additional improvements.

Colemak Club is currently hosted on my website at [gnusenpai.net](https://gnusenpai.net/colemakclub/) and alternatively on my [GitHub Pages](https://gnusenpai.github.io/colemakclub/).
